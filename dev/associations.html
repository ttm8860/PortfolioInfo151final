      <h1>My Professional and Community Associations</h1>
      <p>
        Being actively involved in organizations that align with my identity, interests, and career goals has helped me grow both personally and professionally. Two communities that have had a particularly meaningful impact on my journey are the Drexel African Student Association (DASA) and Women in Computing Society (WiCS).
      </p>
      <p>
        DASA connects students of African descent and anyone interested in African culture through cultural events, community service, and student support. As an event organizer for DASA, I have helped foster a sense of belonging on campus and celebrate the richness of African traditions and perspectives.
